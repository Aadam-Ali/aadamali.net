Makers Academy (learning provider) and HMRC (His Majesty&rsquo;s Revenue &
Customs), achieving a distinction. I want to share my experience, both
for my own reflection and to help people decide whether an
apprenticeship in tech is right for them.</p><p>I&rsquo;d like you to keep in mind that everyone&rsquo;s experience is subject to
their employer, and learning provider, so my point of view will not be
the same as another person who has done an apprenticeship with a
different learning provider and/or employer.</p><h2 id=why-did-i-choose-an-apprenticeship>Why Did I Choose An Apprenticeship?</h2><p>First of all, let&rsquo;s cover the main reasons as to why you&rsquo;d want to do
an apprenticeship - particularly as someone who has just completed their
A-Levels:</p><ul><li>By doing an apprenticeship you get a paid job, which offers a greater
financial incentive over going to university where you&rsquo;d have to pay
Â£9,250 per year.</li><li>Apprenticeships encourage hands on, on the job learning, which for
those like me who learn by doing is highly beneficial.</li><li>You gain industry specific knowledge</li><li>You gain valuable industry experience and a recognised qualification
that will give you an advantage when looking for future employment</li></ul><p>My motivation to do an apprenticeship stemmed from the fact that I felt
that I had the skillset to take on an entry level Software or DevOps
Engineering role. Additionally, considering the reasons I mentioned
earlier contributed to my decision, particularly not having to take out
student loans in order to attend university and instead earning a pretty
good salary.</p><h2 id=why-makers-academy>Why Makers Academy?</h2><p>Just like applying to university, when applying for apprenticeships you
want the best of the best. When looking through my options, Makers
Academy stood out as one of the better learning providers because of
their <a href=https://www.ratemyapprenticeship.co.uk/company-profile/967/makers-academy-limited/reviews target=_blank rel=noopener>glowing
reviews</a>.</p><p>It&rsquo;s also worth noting that Makers Academy is a recognised learning
provider that is on the <a href=https://download.apprenticeships.education.gov.uk/apar target=_blank rel=noopener>Government&rsquo;s Register of Apprenticeship
Training
Providers</a>, and
received a Good rating in their <a href=https://reports.ofsted.gov.uk/provider/33/2539248 target=_blank rel=noopener>last Ofsted
inspection</a> in 2022.</p><p>They are trusted by a range of organisations including Government
Departments (HMRC and DWP are the two I know of), and other household
names such as Tesco, British Gas, and HSBC.</p><p>Other reasons can be found throughout my <a href=#bootcamp>Bootcamp</a> and
<a href=#placement>Placement</a> experience.</p><h2 id=why-did-i-choose-hmrc>Why Did I Choose HMRC?</h2><p>I applied for tens of apprenticeships and junior positions across a
range of organisations across the United Kingdom. Out of those, the two
I was most successful with during the application process were HMRC and
DWP - fortunately, these were the two I was most happy to receive an
offer for due to being in the Civil Service and the
<a href=https://www.civil-service-careers.gov.uk/civil-service-employee-benefits/ target=_blank rel=noopener>benefits</a>
that come with that.</p><p>However, HMRC always had a slight edge over DWP for two reasons. HMRC&rsquo;s
job description provided a more detailed insight into the
responsibilities of the role, as well as the projects I&rsquo;d be working on.
They also provided a list of technologies of which a few I was already
comfortable with such as Linux, Git, Python, and Docker. This allowed me
to paint a good picture of what I would be working on day to day and I
decided that it was what I wanted.</p><p>The second reason was discovered later on in the application process,
during the final interview. Out of all the interviews I had, my
interview with HMRC was by far the best one that I had in terms of
performance and experience (I&rsquo;ll touch on this later).</p><h2 id=application>Application</h2><p>After recollecting my application experience, I was shocked to realise
that the entire process took somewhere between 3 to 4 months. Although,
the process was quite drawn out, it was also the first time that HMRC
had employed apprentices with Makers and I&rsquo;m certain that was a
contributing factor.</p><p>The first step was filling in an application with HMRC via <a href=https://www.civilservicejobs.service.gov.uk/csr/jobs.cgi target=_blank rel=noopener>Civil
Service Jobs</a>,
after which I waited a few weeks before receiving an email notifying me
of my progression to the next phase of recruitment, to be carried out by
Makers.</p><p>A few weeks later, I was sent an email from Makers outlining the next
steps of the process. This included completing a Ruby Codecademy course,
a short Coderbyte assessment based on the course, and a telephone
interview. What wasn&rsquo;t originally mentioned in the email was the
requirement to complete a questionnaire before booking the telephone
interview; the questionnaire contained questions about why I wanted to
do an apprenticeship in the software industry, and a couple of scenario
based questions.</p><p>Once I was successful in completing those steps, I was able to book my
interview with HMRC - one of, if not, the best interviews I&rsquo;ve ever had
because of how the interviewers treated me, this really boosted my
confidence and is probably why I was able to do so well.</p><p>Roughly a week later, I received a provisional offer that took a month
or so to materialise into an actual offer with my start date being a
week later.</p><h2 id=bootcamp>Bootcamp</h2><p><em>Disclaimer: The bootcamp structure may have changed</em></p><p>Makers apprenticeships are structured in a way that all the learning
they deliver is front loaded, this is done to provide apprentices with
enough knowledge to start contributing to their teams straight away. The
learning is also delivered in a way that doesn&rsquo;t expect prior knowledge
from apprentices, making it suitable for pretty much anyone.</p><p>The bootcamp is 12 weeks long for Software Development apprentices and
18 weeks for DevOps Engineer apprentices. The first 10 weeks cover
software development topics, from the basics of programming to
object-oriented programming to web applications, pair programming,
working in an agile team, and more. If you do the Software Development
track, you then do a final project for the last two weeks before
starting your placement.</p><p>As alluded to earlier, you do start off by learning Ruby but in the
later weeks you are given the chance to learn a language more relevant
to your placement - for me this was Python.</p><p>At this point, the DevOps Engineer apprentices break off into the DevOps
course for 8 weeks, which covers DevOps topics such as cloud (AWS,
though I believe this depends on the cohort), containerisation,
reliability, and more. Similarly to the software development track, the
course ends with a two week project before starting your placement.</p><p>The final project for both tracks is done as a team (subset of the
cohort) and then demoed to the rest of the cohort and members of the
organisations that apprentices are employed by.</p><p>Throughout the bootcamp, you are supported by coaches who run workshops
where they teach tools and concepts. The coaches are supportive and will
do their best to help you where they can. However, it is important to
state that one of the key themes that underpins the bootcamp is learning
how to learn thus the coaches will make sure you know how to help
yourself when you get stuck instead of becoming reliant on them.</p><p>Overall, I really enjoyed the bootcamp, particularly the DevOps phase
because it was where I started to feel challenged as I was already
familiar with the topics taught in the Software Development phase from
my own self-led learning and GCSE and A-Level Computer Science courses.
While, I didn&rsquo;t feel too challenged during the Software Development
phase, it was a good opportunity to work with and help members of my
cohort - after all the best way to consolidate your knowledge is by
teaching it.</p><h2 id=placement>Placement</h2><p>Not long before the end of the bootcamp I was told which team I would be
in. On the first day of my placement, I was introduced to my team and
team leads. I was already familiar with my manager as we had regular
1:1s during the bootcamp.</p><p>For the first couple of months I was assigned work that had been
labelled for apprentices and newcomers until I had gained a good enough
understanding of my team&rsquo;s products and toolchains used to build and
maintain them. Once, I had that fundamental understanding, I began
working on regular work as any engineer on the team would. However, I
was allowed to deviate from doing so if there was a ticket that would
benefit my development or apprenticeship work.</p><p>Throughout the placement, I had regular meetings with my manager
(weekly), team lead (weekly then fortnightly then monthly), and
placement coach (bimonthly). These meetings made sure I was on track
with my apprenticeship work, happy with how things were going, and able
to ask questions about anything that I was unsure or concerned about.</p><p>Throughout my placement, I had to work on my portfolio, which would be
used as a reference by Makers to determine whether I was ready for
Gateway - essentially approval to start the project. I was able to work
on this during the 20% of working hours that I could dedicate to my
apprenticeship work, a legal requirement for employers to provide
apprentices.</p><h2 id=assessments>Assessments</h2><p>As I was getting closer to being ready for Gateway, Makers provided 1:1
sessions with a technical coach to prepare me for the two assessment
methods, including their structure, going through any final changes that
needed to be made to any supporting documents, and practice questions.
Information about the assessment methods can be found
<a href=https://www.instituteforapprenticeships.org/media/4069/st0825_devops_engineer_l4-ap-for-publication_050320_qm_minor-amend-190320.pdf target=_blank rel=noopener>here</a>.</p><p>The assessment methods focus on 8 key areas:</p><ul><li>Code Quality</li><li>Meeting User Needs</li><li>The CI-CD Pipeline</li><li>Refreshing and Patching</li><li>Operability</li><li>Data Persistence</li><li>Automation</li><li>Data Security</li></ul><p>Assessment Method 1 (AM1) is the &lsquo;Project and Practical Assessment&rsquo;. The
project takes 12 weeks to complete (fixed time frame) with an additional
week for completing the report and presentation, which are submitted
prior to the assessment, in preparation for it. The practical assessment
takes up to 3 hours, and requires you to cover the 8 assessed areas
during the presentation with two questions per assessed area to cover
anything that wasn&rsquo;t spoken about. You are also required to show a code
commit going through a CI/CD pipeline.</p><p>Assessment Method 2 (AM2) is the &lsquo;Professional discussion&rsquo;. This is a 1
hour discussion covering the same 8 assessed areas, with 1 question per
assessed area with prompts to give more detail if necessary. You are
allowed to use your portfolio as a reference because it is open book,
however, I suggest summarising the points to a single page that can be
used as a trigger for your memory.</p><p>AM1&rsquo;s practical assessment is carried out once the project is complete and
submitted - there&rsquo;s a one month window after completion of the project
where your assessment can take place. AM2 on the other hand, can be done
at any point during the EPA (End Point Assessment) period i.e. from the
start of the project.</p><p>My assessments were carried out by BCS, and as far as I am aware the
structure may differ slightly between assessment boards, mainly in
regards to when the assessments are carried out.</p><h2 id=personal-reflection>Personal Reflection</h2><p>Did I make the right choice? Absolutely, there isn&rsquo;t an ounce of regret
for taking the path I did to kickstart my career.</p><p>Over the past two years, I have learnt so much and contributed so much
more than I had anticipated. Much of that is owed to my team and line
manager for supporting me throughout and ensuring that they did as much
as they could to further my development. They, alongside everyone else
that I&rsquo;ve worked with at HMRC, have taught me so much not just about
DevOps and software but also how to conduct myself as a professional,
and for that I&rsquo;ll be forever grateful regardless of where my journey
takes me.</p><p>My apprenticeship was full of highlights, from the feedback on projects
that I worked on, receiving a promotion, being a <a href=https://www.bcs.org/events/awards-and-competitions/uk-it-industry-awards/uk-it-industry-awards-finalists-2023/ target=_blank rel=noopener>finalist in the UK IT
Industry
Awards</a>
Apprentice of the Year category, and achieving a distinction in my
apprenticeship. As someone who has long struggled with impostor
syndrome, and still does, these highlights remind me that I do deserve
to be in the position that I&rsquo;m in.</p><p>With that being said, I was going to include a section about how to be a
good apprentice, or junior engineer but I don&rsquo;t want this post to drag
on so keep an eye out for post covering that in the near future.</p><p>Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions, or would like to
talk about whether an apprenticeship is right for you.</p></section><footer id=footer><hr><br><ul class=links><li><a target=_blank href=https://github.com/Aadam-Ali>GitHub</a></li><li><a target=_blank href=https://gitlab.com/Aadam-Ali>GitLab</a></li><li><a target=_blank href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/aadam-ali>LinkedIn</a></li></ul><br><p>Posts (EXCLUDING CODE SNIPPETS) are licensed under <a target=_blank rel=license href=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/>CC BY-SA 4.0</a>.</p><br><p>&copy Aadam Ali 2023</p></footer></div></body></html>
